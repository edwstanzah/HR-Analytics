Project Briefs:

The client is a large MNC and they have 9 broad verticals across the organisation. One of the problem the client is facing is around identifying the right people for promotion and prepare them in time. Currently, the process they are following is:
* They first identify a set of employees based on recommendations/past performance.
* Selected employees go through the separate training and evaluation program for each vertical. These programs are based on the required skill of each vertical
* At the end of the program, based on various factors such as training performance, KPI completion etc, employees gets promotion

For the aforementioned process, the final promotions are only announced after the evaluation and this leads to delay in transition to their new roles. Hence, the company needs help in identifying the eligible candidates at a particular checkpoint so that they can expedite the entire promotion cycle.
